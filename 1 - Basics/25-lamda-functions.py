# LAMBDA FUNCTION

# Python supports the creation of lamda or anonymous functions 
# (i.e. functions that are not bound to a name) at runtime, 
# using a construct called lambda. 
# This is not same as lambda in functional programming, 
# but a concept well integrated into Python and used in conjunction 
# with typical functional concepts like filter(), map() and reduce()

# Like def keyword, lambda creates a function to be called later. 
# But it returns the function instead of assigning it to a name

# USAGE 
# lambda arg1, arg2, ...argN : expression using arguments
# lambda is an expression, not a statement
# lambda's body is a single expression, not a block of statements.
# def f(x, y, z): return x + y + z
# lambda x, y, z: x + y + z

lamb = lambda x: x ** 3
print(lamb(5))

# allows us to embed a function within the code
# For instance, callback handlers are frequently coded as 
# inline lambda expressions embedded directly in a registration call's arguments list
L = [lambda x: x ** 2,
         lambda x: x ** 3,
         lambda x: x ** 4]
for f in L:
    print(f(3))

# NESTED LAMBDA
# the lambda appears inside a def and so can access the value that 
# the name x has in the function's scope at the time that the enclosing function was called

def action(x):
	# Make and return function, remember x
	return (lambda newx: x + newx)

# lambda also has access to the names in any enclosing lambda
action = (lambda x: (lambda newx: x + newx))
ans = action(99)
