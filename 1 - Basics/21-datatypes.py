import sys
import array as arr

name = "str"
age = 10
# Integers in Python 3 are of unlimited size.

# Python 2 has two integer types - int and long.
# # There is no 'long integer' in Python 3 anymore.
# Long function is in 2.x
# https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html
# Long is not there in 3.x
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

# Conversion to long. Works with only python 2.x and not python3
# Function:: long(x, base=10)
# print(long(ages))

ages = 10.54
# Floats may also be in scientific notation, 
# with E or e indicating the power of 10 (2.5e2 = 2.5 x 10power2 = 250).

agess = 10.56j

# INBUILT TYPES
list = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
tuples = ("w", "e", "t", "y")
sets = set([1,2,3,4,5,6])
fsets = frozenset([1,2,3,4,5,6])

# DATA TYPES
arrys = arr.array('d', [1,2,3,4,5,6])

# http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/python-memory-management.html
# Long was explained as Complex
#  It was not complex!! but long
# Complex numbers representation is for "Complex numbers"
# Complex numbers follow a + bJ, 
# ** Both a and b are floats 
# and J (or j) represents the square root of -1 (which is an imaginary number). 
# The real part of the number is a, and the imaginary part is b. 
# Complex numbers are not used much in Python programming.
