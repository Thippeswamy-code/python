class Parent:

        self.val = val
    def printVal(self):
        print(self.val)

# Simple inheritance of Parent class by DerivedChild
# DerivedChild class with a method and inheritance of Parent class
class DerivedChild(Parent):

        self.val = -self.val

class DerivedChildtwo(DerivedChild):
    def negateVal(self):
        self.val = -self.val

# Instantiate the child class - DerivedChild

# isinstance is an instance of Foo class
print(isinstance(obj1, Parent))

# issubclass function below checks if DerivedFoo is an inherited class of Foo
